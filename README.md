### Dockerfile

A raspberrypi3-debian-based image with `Calibre` installed. As of 2022-02-02, no Raspbian-compatible version of `Calibre` exists. Thus, running `Calibre` on a Docker container on your Raspberry Pi is a convenient workaround.

### fetch-news-k8s-cron-job.yml

K8s CronJob running scripts/run_recipes.sh in the Calibre-compatible Docker container every Friday at 6 A.M.

### /scripts

`install.sh` - `rcloneÂ´ installation script.

`run_rclonesync.sh` - script for syncing a remote Dropbox folder with a local directory. Perfect for a cronjob.

`run_recipes.sh` - script for running `ebook-convert` to fetch news and store them as epubs in the /fetched-news folder.

### /instructions

This folder contains instruction files for
- building a Docker image with Calibre installed which can run as a container on my Raspberry Pi;
- installing `K3s` on Raspbian;
- setting up a K8s CronJob using `K3s` which runs the news-fetching script inside the Docker container with `Calibre` installed;
- setting up `rclone` and `rclonesync`

### /fetched-news

Fetched news epubs show up here.
